# Introduction
Filters in Sumboard enhance the interactivity and usability of your dashboards by allowing users to focus on specific data subsets. Filters can be applied to individual charts providing a tailored view of the data. Sumboard supports different types of filters to ensure flexibility. 

## Default filters
Default filters are predefined and readily available for use in your dashboards. These filters cover common needs such as **date range filtering** and **aggregations**. See more details in the [default filters section](/filters/default/).

## Custom Filters
Custom filters offer greater flexibility, allowing editors to create their own filtering criteria based on specific needs. These filters appear as dropdown menus in the UI, giving users control over the data they wish to analyze. See more details in the [custom filters section](/filters/custom/).

## External Filters
External filters provide the ability to integrate Sumboard's filtering capabilities with external systems or applications. These filters are managed outside of Sumboard, but their effects are reflected in the embedded dashboards. 

This type of filter is ideal for complex scenarios where filtering logic is controlled by external business processes or applications. See more details in the [external filters section](/filters/external/).
