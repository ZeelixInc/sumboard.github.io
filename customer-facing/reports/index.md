# Reports
Reports are documents generated based on your dashboards, which can be downloaded directly or sent via email using [Schedules](/customer-facing/schedules/). Sumboard offers three types of reports:
* Excel
* PDF
* Image

## Excel
When creating an Excel report from a dashboard, each chart is exported to its own worksheet, named after the chart. The file name will include the dashboard name and the generation time. By default, the Excel report will not include images but will list the applied filters and the generation date.
