### User Management
Users can now invite and manage other users.

### A couple of words about what's next in Sumboard
We are excited to share that enhanced PDF layout customization and versioning are on the horizon. Customers have requested more control over PDF layouts to create custom schedules and reports. Versioning will allow you to replicate workflows with separate data sources per environment and the ability to publish new versions. Go create some dashboards and share your thoughts with us.
