# Database security
To enhance security, you can configure an **SSL/SSH** connection for each data connection. Using SSL encrypts data in transit, providing an additional layer of protection.

We recommend taking additional measures for security:
- Enabling **SSL/SSH** connection
- **Access control**: Create a user with **read** rights only for Sumboard connection

For any specific security concerns or detailed inquiries, please contact our support team at support@sumboard.io.
