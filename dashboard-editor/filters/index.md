## Filter types
Sumboard supports the following filter types to enhance data interactivity:
* **Time range** - This filter allows users to specify a date range and compare data between two different time periods.
* **Aggregation** - Aggregates data values based on selected intervals such as daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly, providing a summarized view of the data.
* **Custom** - User-created filters that appear in the top bar as a selectable UI element. These filters derive their values from the queries you set up, offering tailored filtering options.
* **External** - Filters that do not fit into the above categories. You control the UI and the values, but in Sumboard, they will appear as a simple input field for string values.

## Filter label
The display name for the filter, shown instead of the raw filter label. You can specify this name when creating the filter or at the dashboard level.
