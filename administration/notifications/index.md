For more information on DNS authentication, please refer to [SendGrid's documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/senders).

Add a support email that will appear in the footer of every email notification. This ensures that your recipients can easily reach out for assistance if needed. Simply fill in the designated field with your support email address.

## Unsubscribe Page
