## Creating a custom theme
To create a custom theme:
1. Add a theme name: Enter a descriptive name for your custom theme.
2. Hex codes for colors: Provide the hex codes for the colors you wish to use. These colors will be applied in visualizations in the order you specify. For example, in a bar or pie chart with multiple values, the first value will use the first color, the second value will use the second color, and so on.
