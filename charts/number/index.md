The Number chart in Sumboard allows you to display a single numeric value, making it ideal for showcasing key metrics or KPIs within your dashboard.

In the configuration sidebar, you can customize the following options:
- **Chart title**: Add or disable the chart title to provide context for the displayed number.
- **Value**: Select the column that contains the numeric value to be displayed.
- **Column title**: Customize the title of the column.
- **Column type**: Choose from Date/time, number, currency, percent, string, or duration.

### Column type options
- If the column type is number, you can specify the number of decimal places to display.
- If the column type is currency, define the currency placeholder (by default it uses the value from workspace settings).
- If the column type is duration, select its style: Narrow, Short, or Long, used to display specific durations (e.g., "3 seconds").
