- **Column settings**: Customize each column's title and data type (Date/time, number, currency, percent, string, duration).
- **Column alignment**: Align columns to the left, center, or right for better readability.
- **Calculate totals**: Enable to calculate totals for numeric columns, providing summary insights directly within the table.

### Column type options
- **Number**: Specify the number of decimal places to display.
- **Currency**: Define the currency placeholder (default is from workspace settings).
- **Duration**: Choose the duration style: Narrow, Short, or Long, for displaying specific time durations (e.g., "3 seconds").
